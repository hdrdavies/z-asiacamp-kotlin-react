# z-asiacamp-kotlin-react

Hi! :wave: Thanks for joining my workshop!

### Setup

You probably should have done this before! If not, go to the [associated repo](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app) and follow the guide.

If you need documentation, kotlin can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/), and react [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

### Mission

We will be building a sample :spaghetti: recipe app :spaghetti: Features include:

1. Entering a name, ingredients and a description with the steps
2. Have pictures (with weblinks and img tags, no need to store them)
3. Have some ranking for difficulty and quality
4. Add the time needed
5. Can all be stored in memory, no need to have a database or backend
6. No need to make it look super nice

#### Stretch goals

1. Add comments to the recipe
2. Share them on social media
3. Write some unit tests

If you get this far, time to help someone else! :wink:

### Agenda

Pair up for the workshop. Try to mix levels of experience and pair up with someone you haven't worked with before if possible. 

At half-time, we'll come together and discuss our progress, how we're finding it so far, and if anyone needs help.

At full-time, we'll have a quick demo of our apps, discuss the pros and cons of the technology, any observations or other points of interest, and see what we learnt! 

### Guidelines 

1. Switch who is typing in the pair, to make sure everyone gets time
2. Use post-it notes to keep ideas / difficulties / observations to discuss later on
